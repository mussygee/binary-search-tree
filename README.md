🌳 Binary Search Tree Traversal (Java)
📌 Overview

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java and explores multiple tree traversal algorithms. It demonstrates how data can be stored hierarchically and accessed using different traversal strategies, such as preorder, inorder, and postorder.

The project emphasizes data structures, recursion, clean object-oriented design, and unit testing.

⚙️ Features
